If you are not given a pod definition file, you may extract the definition to a file using the below command:

    kubectl get pod <pod-name> -o yaml > pod-definition.yaml

    Then edit the file to make the necessary changes, delete and re-create the pod.

    Use the kubectl edit pod <pod-name> command to edit pod properties.
